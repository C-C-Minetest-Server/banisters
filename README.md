# banisters

Banisters mod for Minetest. Adds straight and diagonal banisters for stairs railings.

## How can be they crafted?
You can craft normal banisters simply by using this recipe:
```
[M] [M] [M]
[S] [ ] [S]
[ ] [ ] [ ]
```

Or you can craft a (little) more fancy one using this recipe:
```
[M] [M] [M]
[S] [S] [S]
[ ] [ ] [ ]
```

Where "M" is the material you want to use (wood, stone, etc) and "S" is `default:stick`.

## How to use them?
You can place them diagonally by pointing to a side of a stair or slope while facing slightly left or right. If you want to put a horizontal banister, just put it looking straight ahead to a wall or over the ground.
